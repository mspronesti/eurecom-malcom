# Machine Learning for Communication Systems

This repository contains personal solutions to the lab assignments of the MALCOM
(Machine Learning for Communication Systems) course at EURECOM (Spring 2022).

## Lab1
From scratch implementation of a 2-layer fully-connected neural network and test on the CIFAR-10 dataset

## Lab2
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for digits images generation, trained on MNIST.

## Lab3
Federated Learning and Clustered Federated Learning, following the approach proposed by Felix Sattler et al. in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01991) paper.
